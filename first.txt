To identify the causative agent of disease, Robert Koch developed a series of steps called Koch’s postulates, and proved that specific microorganism is responsible for the specific disease. In this study, milk and yogurt are used to demonstrate Koch’s postulates by identifying the particular microbe in the yogurt that was responsible for fermenting liquid milk into solid yogurt. Gram-positive was found to be the causative agent of turning milk into yogurt. However, a gram-negative bacterial strain was also found when bacterial colonies were introduced into healthy, susceptible host milk. In conclusion, Koch’s postulate is an effective way to identify the causative agent of disease responsible for the specific diseases.
